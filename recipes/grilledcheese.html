        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
            <li>Butter – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
            <li>Cheese – we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter the toast – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Heat skillet – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.<li>
            <li>Add cheese – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
            <li>Brown the toast – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Serve – cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
        </ol>
